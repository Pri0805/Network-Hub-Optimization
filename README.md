# Network-Hub-Optimization

1. Consider a network of N cities, where dij denotes the distance between a pair of cities (i, j). For each pair of cities (i, j), there are fij number of packages that need to be shipped from city i to city j. Designing a linear optimization model to find a hub-and-spoke configuration with K ∈ [1, N ) hub(s) for Company XYZ, such that the total distance traveled by all packages is minimized, taking into account the volume of deliveries between each pair of cities. Additionally, introducing a discount factor α ≤ 1 for transit between hub cities to reflect scale-effects in inter-hub flows.
2. Setting α = 0.75, solving the optimization problem you designed for K = 2 using Gurobi. After the optimization, plotting the cities on a Cartesian coordinate system. Varying the number of hubs (K) to 1, 4, and 6, and for each value of K, solving the optimization problem and calculate the total distance traveled by all the packages.
3. Each stop incurs operational overhead costs, including labor, administrative tasks, and potential delays. Completeting analysis of how these overhead costs impact the network. Assuming a nonnegative flat cost of c to handle one package at each intermediate hub, calculating and analyzing the operational overhead cost per package at intermediate stops. Illustrating how the total operational overhead cost changes with the number of hubs (K).
4. Incorporating the cost c per package for each intermediate stop in the objective function. Solving this cost-inclusive model using a solver for K = 2 for different nonnegative values of c and evaluating how this cost consideration affects the network design and the total distance traveled by all the packages. Providing insights into the trade-offs between minimizing travel distance and managing the cost of intermediate stops.
5. Reflecting on the practicalities and advantages of the hub-and-spoke model as you work with the dataset and approach the network optimization.
